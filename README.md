  <b>llist</b><br>
  <a>A circular linked list dynamic library</a>
</p>

##### WTF

The library is a set of operations on type oblivious, easy-to-use, circularly-linked list.

_**llist** is not meant to be embedded into any project and is for practice's sake only._

#### Usage:
``` c
struct my_kernail_list {
         int data;
         char c;
         struct list_head list;
};
```
The list is inside the user-defined data item. A member of type `struct list_head` can be anywhere in the user-defined structure. The `struct list_head` variable can have any name.

#### Sorting algorithm

Merge sort of a linked list was heavily inspired by Dathan Bennet's [*MergeSort in Haskell*](https://medium.com/@dathanbennett/mergesort-in-haskell-df3c446f3ae3). It is so visually comprehensive that I will have to embed it here:

``` haskell
mergeSort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
mergeSort [] = []
mergeSort [a] = [a]
mergeSort a =Â·
  merge (mergeSort firstFew) (mergeSort lastFew)
    where firstFew = take ((length a) `div` 2) a
          lastFew = drop ((length a) `div` 2) a

-- Expects a and b to already be sorted
merge :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
merge a [] = a
merge [] b = b
merge (a:as) (b:bs)
  | a < b     = a:(merge as (b:bs))
  | otherwise = b:(merge (a:as) bs)
```
#### Build from source on Mac:

``` console
gcc -shared -fpic llist.c -o libllist.dylib
```

To test the library compile and run:

``` console
gcc -o test test.c libllist.dylib
./test
```

#### Build from source on Ubuntu:

Compile the library sources into position-independent code:
``` console
gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic llist.c
```

Turn the object file into a shared library:

``` console
gcc -shared -o libllist.so llist.o
```

The run path will embed location in the executable during the linking
stage, instead of relying on default locations or environment variables.

``` console
gcc -L. -Wl,-rpath=. -Wall -o test test.c -lllist
```
  * **-L** tells the linker where to find the library.

  * **-Wl** sends comma-separated options to the linker.

  * **-rpath** tells the loader where to find the library.
